# Pricing - The Fine Print

We typically provide a cocktail tasting prior to your event for $50, which includes four mini cocktails for two people. This fee applies toward your total if you book with us. This is entirely optional and may be omitted if you trust us unconditionally.

Our event fee covers two bartenders for six hours of service. If you need more time, or if your event is large enough to need more bartenders, we will work out a higher base fee. A travel fee may be added for events outside of the Portland metro area.

The event fee is due upon booking. The rest of the payment is split into two parts: half is due upon finalizing the menu, and half is due two weeks before the event.

Minor modifications to The Classics will be considered on a case by case basis.

If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to [reach out](/contact), even if you are not quite ready to book.
