[Click here to read the fine print.](/pricing/fine-print)

### The Classics <span class="right">$8</span>

This includes most of your well-known cocktails, both vintage and modern, with no modifications. Anything from a Margarita or Daiquiri to an Old Fashioned or Manhattan goes here.

### The Originals <span class="right">$10</span>

These are the bespoke, one of a kind cocktails that we specialize in. This is our bread and butter. We will craft a unique, never before seen cocktail tailored specifically towards you and your event.

### The Showstoppers <span class="right">$12+</span>

If you need some cocktail flair in your life, this is where you'll be. Any cocktails that require foams, flames, or over the top garnishes fall into this category. Prices vary depending on the request, but will generally fall in the $12-15 range.

### The Ones That Don't Give You a Hangover <span class="right">$6+</span>

Non-alcoholic cocktail options are available for anyone not drinking for any reason (or that friend who needs to reign it in a bit). Pricing on these drinks varies, so please [get in touch](mailto:hello@theminimalmixologist.com) for more information.

### Beer, Wine, and Other Stuff <span class="right">20% markup</span>

We will happily supply non-cocktail beverages at a 20% markup over retail price.
